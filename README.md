# Keyboard Manipulation Scripts
### What is this?
This is a folder containing source code for manipulating keyboard layout files.

### What problem are you trying to solve?
Often a person who does not use the most popular kind of keyboard layout (QWERTY) is forced to either use a QWERTY based layout or make a derivative keyboard layout one key at a time. All this person wants to do is swap the keys around to type similarly, doing this manually is tedious. This project intends to automate it.

People who only type in one language might not see the need for this. People who have keyboard layouts based on QWERTY for typing exotic symbols might.

### Are there already existing solutions to this problem?
People on the internet seem to talk about programmable keyboards where one can switch between QWERTY and DVORAK at the hardware level. This is interesting but expensive.

Technically, a person can use a program called Ukelele which provides a user interface for editing keyboard layouts, but it does not have a single button way to convert keyboard layouts between QWERTY and DVORAK.

### How much do you intend to implement?
I intend to implement some functions for swapping the values of keys. I do not intend to implement a graphical user interface, nor the ability to process a whole file at once. The user will have to copy the XML or formatted text from the keyboard layout many lines at a time and paste it in.

### When was this started?
December 2020.

### What do I need to run this?
- Python 3.8.3 (may work on some lower versions)
- user level access to a terminal/command prompt
